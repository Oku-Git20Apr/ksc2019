***real_prop_chamber.C:
Simulation of the proportional chamber.
Angle pattern of the chambers are 4. (0, 30, 60, 90 deg)
Most probable simulation

**prop_chamber.C:(plane approximation, old type)
Simulation of the proportional chamber.
Angle pattern of the chambers are 4. (0, 30, 60, 90 deg)


*prop_chamber_angle.C:
Simulation of the proportional chamber.
Angle dependence is shown.


*hist_monte.C:
This can make a histgram from "montecalro_data.txt"


*montecarlo.C (Kajikawa):
This is simple zenith angle distribution of cosmic rays.
(Assuming cos^2(theta))
This does not include any information of detectors.


*cos.C (Toyama):
For the Spark Chamber
